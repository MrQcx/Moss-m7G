# Master-m7G
A motif-based interpretable deep learning method for RNA N7-methlguanosine sites prediction

# Introduction
N-7methylguanosine (m7G) modification plays a crucial role in various biological processes and is closely associated with the development and progression of many cancers.In this work, we designed a novel motif-based interpretable method for m7G modification site prediction, called Master-m7G.
